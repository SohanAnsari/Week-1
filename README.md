# Week-1
This is a project predicting the solar power output using a combination of various meteorological and solar-related features, linear regression, and forecasting power generation between environmental factors and how such relationships might help build a better predictive model.

# Improvisation done 
Added scatter plots showing the relationship of important features - temperature, cloud cover, to generated power. Created a correlation heatmap to detect key predictors that would influence generation. Also added boxplot to get an idea about the distribution, and to flag outliers in target variable generated_power_kw.
